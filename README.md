# Hello World!

I'm a full-stack software engineer with a background in Industrial Design Engineering. Originally from Seville, I began my career in Barcelona and now live in Madrid, Spain.

I started out as a UX/UI designer and gradually transitioned into front-end development before becoming a full-stack developer. My work has focused on data visualization, data platforms, and advanced web scraping. My core tech stack includes PostgreSQL, Python, Django/FastAPI, Vue/Nuxt, and D3. I'm also experienced with MongoDB, PHP, WordPress, jQuery, Angular, AWS, GIS tools, and various design software. I work daily with Git and Jira and have hands-on experience with agile methodologies like SCRUM.

Beyond my professional work, Iâ€™ve coordinated numerous non-profit projects, mostly centered around software, open data, and design.
