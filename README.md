# Hello World!

I'm a full-stack web developer with Industrial Design Engineering background.

I started working as a UX/UI designer, evolving to front-end and later to full-stack developer specialized in data visualization, data platforms and advanced web scrapers. My main stack is PostgreSQL, Python, Django, Vue and D3, and I have extensive experience with MongoDB, PHP, Wordpress, jQuery, Angular, AWS, GIS and design software.
