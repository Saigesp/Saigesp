# Hello World!

I'm a full-stack web developer with Industrial Design Engineering background.

I started working as UX/UI designer, evolving into a developer more than 7 years ago, first as a front-end and later as a full-stack specialized in data visualization, data platforms development and advanced web scrapers. My main stack is Python, Django, Vue and D3, and I have extensive experience with PHP, Wordpress, jQuery, Angular and design software.
